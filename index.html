          <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
            <p>Hello! First of all thank you so much for visiting my first hand coded HTML website! My name is Lawrence Chang and I am a twenty six year old aspiring developer from Los Angeles, California.  I attended the University of California, Los Angeles and received my B.A. in Economics in 2010. Growing up in such a diverse city, I have always loved to experience new cuisines, traditions and culture. I have had the opportunity to travel to France, Germany, Kosovo, South Korea, Mexico and various states in the U.S. and hope to add onto this list in the future. Some of my other passions include <a href="http://www.golfnow.com" target="_blank">playing a round of golf on Sunday afternoons</a>, <a href="http://www.pandora.com" target="_blank">listening to music</a> and <a href="http://www.ucla.scout.com" target="_blank">cheering on U.C.L.A. football and basketball</a>. My aspirations are to wake up every morning loving what I do, always making a positive impact on those around me and owning a dog. </p>
          <br>
          <h2> CANDIDACY </h2>
            <p>I remember the first time I felt I could encourage others to make their lives better. In the summer of 2001, I had the opportunity to volunteer in assisting a small community in Kosovo. With only three weeks to make an impact, I proposed to my team that we create the community&#8217;s first soccer field as a side project. There were several lots of land on the outskirts of town filled with debris that had untapped potential. To clear a lot, I went door-to-door seeking volunteers to help remove the debris while organizing a budget for necessary materials for the field. After two weeks the field was complete and was a huge hit within the community. Throughout the whole process I learned several vital lessons but one in particular that has guided me over the years: if I take the initiative to make a change, I can make a real difference. </p>
            <p>I believe I can be a good fit with my Launch Academy peers who are also collaborative, motivated to succeed and passionate about helping others. Moreover, Launch Academy's philosophy to support one another is a mentality that I grew up with. Members of the Korean community in the greater Los Angeles area connect with one another because they share similar ambitions, struggles and experiences. Sharing and collaborating, traits I developed perhaps due to my family&#8217;s inherent need in difficult times, are qualities I look to bring to Launch Academy. Furthermore, Launch Academy&#8217;s composition of goal-driven, zealous, excited and successful individuals is very appealing since it is aligned with who I am and who I want to become. </p>

      <br>Dear Bill Rowell and Launch Academy,
      <br>It was a pleasure talking with you today. I wanted to say thank you once again for taking the time to discuss with me what Launch Academy has to offer and answering any questions I had. Receiving insight into the program environment, faculty mentality and student expectations were all invaluable. Moreover, our meeting has only confirmed my passion to pursue my progamming education at Launch Academy. I will continue to strive towards my aspiration of becoming a successful developer and hope to have the opportunity to become a Launcher. Thank you and have a wonderful day!
      <br>
      <br>Best Regards,
      <br>Lawrence Chang</p>
